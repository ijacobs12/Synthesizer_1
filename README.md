# Synthesizer_1
My first synthesizer! Three-oscillator additive synth with adjustable pitch/frequency offset and cutoff for each oscillator. Also has autobend, pitch wheel bend range modification, vibrato (optionally via modwheel), master amp/master cutoff LFO and ADSR control. Built using JUCE. 
Requires the maximillian DSP library: https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian
